### My goal for this assignment was to describe and reverse engineer the code provided. I explained 'every' file and it's purpose in as fine as detail as possible. I included the routes for files dependant on other files. At the end of the tutorial, there are instructions for how you can add changes to the project.

## Issues with the project:

</u>

<br>

- I had issues resolving some bugs, so it I had to finish that before completing the layout of the page. 

    -  I solved the bugs by going through each of the errors and trying out different things until I fixed each one.
